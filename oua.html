    <h3>background</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">In the Fall of 2017 I studied abroad in Arezzo, Italy; a small Tuscan city 45 minutes outside of Florence. I attended my university’s study abroad campus (OUA) with 23 other students.<br><br>

Learning how to navigate a completely new country was tough. Our family and friends were no longer a drive away and tasks as simple as going to the doctor or grocery store felt intimidating. As a creative media intern, I was tasked with improving the usability and overall design of the <b>OUA Touch Screen</b>, a resourceful device that was located in our living space lobby.<br><br>
<img src="images/IMG_0932.JPG"><br>

Over the course of my internship, I worked closely with my boss and campus director to make the touchscreen a product that students could depend on to ease their transition to Italy, and to make their study abroad experience more meaningful.

      <h3 class="heading-7">the product</h3>
      <p>The OUA Touch Screen was the source for <span><strong>bridging the gap between life in Arezzo, Italy and life back in Norman, Oklahoma</strong>. </span>Throughout the entire semester, me and my classmates lived in residential halls (a renovated living space that was previously a monastery). Students could use the touch screen located in “the monastery” lobby to do various tasks (check the for local events, restaurant locations, etc.). Unfortunately, the screen had been neglected in past semesters. The OUA Touch Screen didn't have a purpose, and because it wasnt particularly useful, students weren't using it. </p>

    <!-- <h3 class="heading-11">the problem</h3>
    <p class="paragraph-2">When students walked into the residential halls, they were greeted with the touch screen. Because I was getting familiar with my new surroundings, the first week was hectic and I found myself running in and out of the front doors. I also found that I even I didn&#x27;t ever think about using the touch screen. Weeks followed before I formally begin my internship, but before I began drafting ideas, I noticed the screen lacked vibrancy. At first glance, a user couldn&#x27;t tell what the purpose of the touchscreen was. Which led my classmates (and me even!) to walk right past it. To change this first impression, I altered the icons spacing and changed the background. Even a fix as simple as this made my classmates take notice. Once I tackled this, I begin to brainstorm for more ways to increase the usability.<br></p>
    <h3 class="heading-8">the &quot;News Stand&quot;</h3> -->

    <!-- <h3 class="heading-9">the problem: transitioning</h3>
    <p>A major obstacle me and my classmates had to overcome was adjustingto living in a new country. Our family and friends were no longer a drive away and we weren't sure how to navigate
    going to the doctor or getting around. Upon arriving, we all went through a study abroad orientation crash course. This was helpful, but it was extremely overwhelming (especially considering we were all jetlagged).
    In realizing this, I worked closely with my boss to make the OUA Touchscreen a tool to <i>ease the transition period</i>.</p> -->



    <h3 class="heading-9">touch screen features</h3>
    <p>Incorporating information about travel information, pharmacy options, and more, helped students feel
    more comfortable navigating an unfamiliar setting. Below are some features included in the OUA touch screen.</p><br>

    <li>nearby restaurants and grocery stores </li>
    <li>local events in Arezzo </li>
    <li>travel advisories</li>
    <li>messages from home</li>



    <h3 class="heading-9">the news stand</h3>

    <p>It&#x27;s easy to get detached from current events/happenings back in the states, and I wanted my classmates to feel like they had a connection with home. The goal of this feature was to embody an actual newsstand,
      by giving students the option to go up to the touchscreen and pick a news source of their choice. I decided to add the OU Daily (our campus newspaper), and other news outlets (based on my classmates preferred sources). I updated these sources weekly with headline events.</p><br>

      <div class="w-layout-grid grid-4"><img src="images/newsstand.png" srcset="images/newsstand-p-500.png 500w, images/newsstand.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, (max-width: 991px) 728px, 750px" alt=""><img src="images/NewsStandFinal.png" srcset="images/NewsStandFinal-p-500.png 500w, images/NewsStandFinal.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, (max-width: 991px) 728px, 750px" alt=""></div>
      <p class="paragraph-3">The News stand was a feature to help students feel connected with happenings back home, as well as current events going on in Europe.<br></p>

      <img src="images/twitterSamp.png" srcset="images/twitterSamp-p-500.png 500w, images/twitterSamp-p-800.png 800w, images/twitterSamp-p-1080.png 1080w, images/twitterSamp.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, (max-width: 991px) 728px, 940px" alt="" class="image-14"></div>
      <p class="paragraph-3">Twitter was also a great source for students, especially when it came to the discussion of events in Norman, and the OU Football games.</p>

  <div class="w-container">
    <h3 class="heading-9">events in Italy: connecting with locals</h3>
    <p class="paragraph-4">In order for students to make the most out of their experience abroad, we wanted students to explore. Every weekday, I was going to class with OU students learning courses taught by OU professors. This experience was convenient, but my classmates expressed concerns that they weren&#x27;t getting an authentic experience. With this in mind, we decided to incorporate the events tab. This feature displayed currents events around Arezzo, along with the address of the location. Classmates would attend these events in groups and found it to be a great way to meet Italian locals.<br></p>
    <h3 class="heading-9">traveling abroad: navigating a new landscape </h3>
    <p class="paragraph-7">As expected, students were traveling all over Europe throughout the semester. In the case that students were not aware, a tab was created to update students on potential travel advisories (Ex: Catalonia attempted to secede from Spain during our semester, which prompted an advisory for that particular region). Under the category of travel advisories, we warned students upcoming transportation strikes (yes.. strikes were scheduled in advance). <br><br>Information like this helped prevent travel issues for students and staff at OUA.</p>
   <h3>extras:</h3>
    <p>- Messages from Home <br>- Newsletters from OU&#x27;s Student Activities Council <br>- Photos from class trips <br>- Weather/time in Norman and Arezzo</p>

    <h3 class="heading-10">learnings</h3>
    <p class="paragraph-8">What started as an intimidating role (in familiarity) ended up being a rewarding experience. I learned very quickly that although this was my project, it wasnt my product. When I added features to help make traveling for my classmates easy, <em>the users </em>benefited. For Christmas I added a screen that looped &quot;All I Want for Christmas is You&quot; by Mariah Carey. It sounded like a good idea in my head, but ultimately didn&#x27;t go over well. Making changes and features for my pleasure defeated the purpose of an inclusive design. I was learning the designing basics, and it was a cool first experience.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="w-container">
    <h3 class="heading-10">the takeaway</h3>
    <p>Going in, I wanted to improve OUA Touch Screen and increase its usability. By doing this, and giving students and faculty a product that they could make use of year-round, I believe that I successfully bridged the gap.</p>
